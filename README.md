## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of mini projects built in Python. Each project aims to solve a specific problem or demonstrate a particular concept. Feel free to explore and use any of the code!

## Projects

### === PERSONAL IDEAS

### Project 1: Magic Square Solver

- **Description**: A Python program that automatically generates and solves a magic square based on the user-defined size, ensuring that all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.
- **Features**: Dynamic size selection, step-by-step visualization of the solving process, input validation, and support for both odd and even-sized squares.

### === SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING

### Project 1: Caesar Cipher

- **Description**: A Python program that implements the Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting text using a simple shift mechanism.
- **Features**: User-friendly interface, customizable shift value, encryption and decryption modes, and support for both uppercase and lowercase letters.

### Project 2: Vigenere Cipher

- **Description**: A Python tool that utilizes the Vigen√®re cipher for encrypting text using a keyword for enhanced security over the Caesar cipher.
- **Features**: Keyword-based encryption, decryption capabilities, error handling for invalid inputs, and a clear explanation of the process.

### Project 3: Luhn Algorithm

- **Description**: An implementation of the Luhn algorithm to validate credit card numbers using a checksum formula.
- **Features**: Input validation, detailed output for each step of the algorithm, and the ability to check multiple card numbers at once.

### Project 4: Expense Tracker

- **Description**: A Python application designed to help users track their expenses, categorize spending, and visualize financial trends.
- **Features**: User authentication, customizable categories, monthly reporting, data visualization, and export options for detailed analysis.
